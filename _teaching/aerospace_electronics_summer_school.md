I designed 3x3 hour labs for the summer school, and then a challenge piecing it all together at the end. The 3 labs involved:
- Getting data off a GPS chip
- Using an accelerometer
- Taking photos with the Raspberry Pi Camera
- Tying all these together with a Raspberry Pi and Python

We ran the lab with 16 - 18 year olds. The challenge was to take photos using a drone. The Raspberry Pi was flown up on the drone and would hover over the objects of interest. At this point the students would have to write a little bit of Python to decide when the Pi was static, take a photo and record the GPS coordinates.
